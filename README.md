## 🧠 Overview

Restaurants generate massive transactional data daily, yet most of it remains **underutilized**. **PetPooja AI** bridges this gap by combining **Data Analytics, Machine Learning, LLM Intelligence, and Voice Automation** into a single intelligent system. It acts as a **Revenue Copilot** that helps restaurants increase revenue, reduce inefficiencies, and automate operations.

### ❗ Problem Statement
* **80%** of restaurants fail to leverage PoS data effectively.
* **~35%** revenue loss due to missed upselling.
* Manual phone-based orders lead to errors, delays, and missed opportunities.
* **Restaurants operate on data, but without intelligence.**

## 🧠 Machine Learning Architecture (CORE HIGHLIGHT)

The system is powered by **4 focused ML models** — designed for real-world impact, not overengineering.

### 🔹 1. Demand Prediction Model (The Core Engine)
**Goal:** Forecast future demand.
* **Inputs:** `date, hour, item_id, category, past_sales`
* **Output:** `predicted_quantity`
* **Model:** Random Forest / XGBoost
* **Drives:** Dashboard predictions, Sales forecasting, Inventory planning
> 💡 *“Tomorrow expected orders: 52 (+18%)”*

### 🔹 2. Menu Classification Model
**Goal:** Identify item performance.
* **Logic:** STAR (High sales/high margin), PLOWHORSE (High sales/low margin), PUZZLE (Low sales/high margin), DOG (Low sales/low margin)
* **Approach:** Rule-based (fast & interpretable), extendable to ML classification.
> 💡 *“Paneer Biryani likely to drop to PLOWHORSE”*

### 🔹 3. Revenue Optimization Model
**Goal:** Simulate revenue outcomes.
* **Inputs:** `price, demand, discount`
* **Output:** `projected_revenue`
* **Model:** Regression
* **Enables:** Pricing experiments and profit optimization.
> 💡 *“Increase price by ₹20 → +₹12K monthly profit”*

### 🔹 4. Combo Recommendation Model
**Goal:** Identify item pairings to drive AOV.
* **Model:** Apriori (Association Rule Mining)
* **Enables:** Dynamic combos and upsell recommendations.
> 💡 *“Pizza + Cold Coffee is a high-performing combo”*

### 🔥 Bonus: Inventory Forecasting
Built on the Demand Model, predicts stock exhaustion timelines.
> 💡 *“Cheese will run out in 1.8 days”*
